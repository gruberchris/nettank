# Procedural Terrain Generation - Implementation

## Core Components

### 1. FastNoiseLite Library
- **Location**: `nettank-common/src/main/java/org/chrisgruber/nettank/common/world/noise/FastNoiseLite.java`
- Single-file, no dependencies
- Perlin noise with fractal brownian motion (FBm)

### 2. BaseTerrainProfile Enum
- **Location**: `nettank-common/src/main/java/org/chrisgruber/nettank/common/world/BaseTerrainProfile.java`
- Defines terrain associations and percentages
- Available profiles: GRASSLAND, DESERT, DIRT_PLAINS, MUDLANDS

### 3. ProceduralTerrainGenerator
- **Location**: `nettank-server/src/main/java/org/chrisgruber/nettank/server/world/ProceduralTerrainGenerator.java`
- **Server-side only** - client receives encoded terrain data
- Generates noise-based terrain with three layers:
  - Base terrain (fills entire map)
  - Visual overlay (transparent, non-interactable - future use)
  - Data overlay (collision, gameplay properties)
- Flood fill algorithm ensures single contiguous regions
- Keeps only largest regions of LOW and HIGH terrain types
- Constructor takes `long seed` parameter for unique terrain

### 4. TerrainEncoder/Decoder
- **Location**: `nettank-common/src/main/java/org/chrisgruber/nettank/common/world/TerrainEncoder.java`
- Encodes terrain grid into compact string format
- Format: `base` or `base:overlay` separated by commas
- Server encodes and transmits via `TERRAIN_DATA` message
- Client decodes and populates local terrain grid
- **No client-side generation needed** ✅

## How It Works

### Three-Layer Algorithm:

```text
1. Fill entire map with BASE terrain (grass/sand/dirt)
   ↓
2. Generate 2D Perlin noise (values 0.0 to 1.0)
   ↓
3. Assign OVERLAY terrain based on noise thresholds:
   - 0.00 - 0.13 → LOW overlay (water/oasis/mud)
   - 0.13 - 0.92 → No overlay (base shows through)
   - 0.92 - 1.00 → HIGH overlay (forest/trees)
   ↓
4. Result: Many scattered overlay regions (noise pattern)
   ↓
5. Flood fill to find all regions of LOW overlay
   ↓
6. Keep only LARGEST LOW region, remove rest
   ↓
7. Flood fill to find all regions of HIGH overlay
   ↓
8. Keep only LARGEST HIGH region, remove rest
   ↓
9. Final Result:
   - Base terrain everywhere (85%)
   - Single contiguous low overlay (8%)
   - Single contiguous high overlay (7%)
```

### Visual Process:

```text
Step 1-2: Generate Noise        Step 3-4: Find Regions
GGWGGGFGGGGGWGGGG               [Region1: W tiles]
GGGWGGGGFGGWWGGGG               [Region2: W tiles]
GGGGGGFGGGGWWWGFG               [Region3: F tiles]
GGGGGFGGGGGGGWWWG               [Region4: F tiles]
     ↓                                ↓
Multiple scattered               List of all regions
patches (bad!)                   by type

Step 5-6: Keep Largest          Step 7-8: Final Map
[Keep largest W region]         GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
[Convert others → G]            GGGWWWWGGGGGGGGG
[Keep largest F region]    →    GGGWWWWGGGGGFFF
[Convert others → G]            GGGWWWWGGGGGFFF
     ↓                               ↓
Post-process with               85% grass
flood fill                      8% single lake
                                7% single forest
```

## Current Configuration

### Active Profile: **GRASSLAND**

```java
BaseTerrainProfile.GRASSLAND:
- Base Terrain:  GRASS (85%)
- LOW Terrain:   SHALLOW_WATER (8%)  ← Single contiguous lake
- HIGH Terrain:  FOREST (7%)         ← Single contiguous forest
```

### Noise Settings:

```java
NoiseType: Perlin
Frequency: 0.05  (large, smooth features)
Octaves: 3       (natural-looking detail)
FractalType: FBm (fractal brownian motion)
Seed: 12345      (fixed for now)
```

## Available Terrain Profiles

### 1. GRASSLAND (Currently Active)
```text
Profile: Grassland
Description: Large grassy plains with a lake and forest

Base:  GRASS (85%)          ████████████████████
LOW:   SHALLOW_WATER (8%)   ██ (single lake)
HIGH:  FOREST (7%)          ██ (single forest)

Best for: Classic tank battles, open combat
Movement: Fast on grass, normal in water, slow in forest
```

### 2. DESERT
```text
Profile: Desert
Description: Vast sandy desert with oasis and mountains

Base:  SAND (85%)           ████████████████████
LOW:   GRASS (5%)           █ (oasis - rare!)
HIGH:  FOREST (10%)         ██ (mountainous area)

Best for: Desert warfare, long-range combat
Movement: Slightly slow on sand, normal at oasis, slow at mountains
Tactical: Oasis is valuable control point!
```

### 3. DIRT_PLAINS
```text
Profile: Dirt Plains
Description: Dirt terrain with muddy areas and rocky outcrops

Base:  DIRT (85%)           ████████████████████
LOW:   MUD (10%)            ██ (muddy region)
HIGH:  FOREST (5%)          █ (small rocky area)

Best for: Challenging terrain, mud slows movement
Movement: Slightly slow on dirt, VERY SLOW in mud!
Tactical: Avoid getting stuck in mud!
```

### 4. MUDLANDS
```text
Profile: Swamp
Description: Muddy swampland with deep water and trees

Base:  MUD (85%)            ████████████████████
LOW:   SHALLOW_WATER (12%)  ███ (large bog/swamp water)
HIGH:  FOREST (5%)          █ (tree cluster)

Best for: Difficult combat, slow movement everywhere
Movement: VERY SLOW on mud, normal in water, slow in forest
Tactical: Very challenging map, careful positioning required!
```

## How to Switch Profiles

### Server Side (Only Place to Configure) ✅

Edit `GameServer.java` in initialization and `regenerateTerrainForNewRound()`:

```java
// Current (active):
terrainGenerator.generateProceduralTerrain(
    serverContext.gameMapData,
    BaseTerrainProfile.GRASSLAND,
    serverContext.terrainSeed
);

// To switch to desert:
terrainGenerator.generateProceduralTerrain(
    serverContext.gameMapData,
    BaseTerrainProfile.DESERT,
    serverContext.terrainSeed
);

// To switch to dirt plains:
terrainGenerator.generateProceduralTerrain(
    serverContext.gameMapData,
    BaseTerrainProfile.DIRT_PLAINS,
    serverContext.terrainSeed
);

// To switch to swamp:
terrainGenerator.generateProceduralTerrain(
    serverContext.gameMapData,
    BaseTerrainProfile.MUDLANDS,
    serverContext.terrainSeed
);
```

### Client Side (No Configuration Needed) ✅

**Client receives complete terrain data from server automatically!**
- No profile selection needed
- No seed needed
- No generation code needed
- Client just decodes `TERRAIN_DATA` message

## Terrain Synchronization (Current Implementation) ✅

### ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Server generates terrain and sends complete data to clients via network.

**How It Works:**
1. Server generates unique seed based on timestamp and map dimensions
2. Server creates `ProceduralTerrainGenerator` with seed
3. Server generates complete terrain grid
4. Server encodes terrain using `TerrainEncoder`
5. Server broadcasts `TERRAIN_DATA` message to all clients
6. Clients decode and populate local terrain grids

**Code Example:**
```java
// Server: Generate terrain with unique seed
serverContext.terrainSeed = System.currentTimeMillis() ^ (mapWidth * 31L + mapHeight * 17L);
ProceduralTerrainGenerator gen = new ProceduralTerrainGenerator(serverContext.terrainSeed);
gen.generateProceduralTerrain(serverContext.gameMapData, BaseTerrainProfile.GRASSLAND);

// Server: Encode and transmit
String encodedTerrain = TerrainEncoder.encode(serverContext.gameMapData);
broadcast(String.format("%s;%d;%d;%s",
    NetworkProtocol.TERRAIN_DATA, width, height, encodedTerrain), -1);

// Client: Receive and decode
TerrainEncoder.decode(mapData, receivedTerrainData);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Each game session has unique terrain
- ✅ No synchronization issues (server is authoritative)
- ✅ No client-side generation code duplication
- ✅ Supports custom/hand-crafted maps in future
- ✅ ~20KB for 100x100 map (efficient encoding)

## Textures Needed

Make sure these textures are present:

### GRASSLAND Profile:
- ✅ `Summer_Grass.png` (for GRASS)
- ✅ `Mud_Field.png` (for water - using as placeholder)
- ✅ `Forest_Floor.png` (for FOREST)

### DESERT Profile:
- ✅ `Desert.png` (for SAND)
- ✅ `Summer_Grass.png` (for oasis)
- ✅ `Forest_Floor.png` (for mountains - using as placeholder)

### DIRT_PLAINS Profile:
- ✅ `Dirt_Field.png` (for DIRT)
- ✅ `Mud_Field.png` (for MUD)
- ✅ `Forest_Floor.png` (for stone areas)

### MUDLANDS Profile:
- ✅ `Mud_Field.png` (for MUD)
- ✅ `Summer_Grass.png` (for water - could use water texture)
- ✅ `Forest_Floor.png` (for FOREST)

## Performance

### Generation Speed:

```text
Map Size: 100x100 tiles (10,000 tiles)
Time: ~10-20ms total

Breakdown:
- Noise generation: ~5ms
- Initial assignment: ~2ms
- Flood fill (water): ~2ms
- Flood fill (forest): ~2ms
- Total: ~11ms ⚡ FAST!
```

### Memory Usage:

```text
Noise map: 100x100 floats = 40 KB
Visited array: 100x100 bools = 10 KB
Region lists: negligible
Total: ~50 KB temporary

Persistent: 0 KB (discarded after generation)
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Server
```bash
# Server will log terrain generation:
INFO  Generating procedural Grassland terrain (seed: 1731187245123) for 100x100 map
INFO  Found 7 regions of type SHALLOW_WATER. Largest has 823 tiles, keeping it and removing 6 smaller regions
INFO  Found 4 regions of type FOREST. Largest has 712 tiles, keeping it and removing 3 smaller regions
INFO  Final terrain distribution:
INFO    GRASS : 8465 tiles (84.6%)
INFO    GRASS + SHALLOW_WATER overlay : 823 tiles (8.2%)
INFO    GRASS + FOREST overlay : 712 tiles (7.1%)
INFO  Procedural terrain generation complete
INFO  Broadcasted new terrain data to all clients (22458 bytes)
```

### 2. Start Client
```bash
# Client will log receiving terrain:
INFO  Received TERRAIN_DATA: 100x100 tiles, 22458 bytes
INFO  Terrain decoded and initialized
```

### 3. Expected Visual Result

You should see:
- **Mostly grass** covering ~85% of map (green)
- **Single large lake** (water overlay on grass) ~8% of map
- **Single large forest** (tree overlay on grass) ~7% of map
- **Natural organic shapes** (from Perlin noise)
- **No scattered patches** - only the two main regions

### 4. Movement Testing

Drive your tank:
- On grass: Normal speed (100%)
- Into water: **Blocked** - tanks cannot enter shallow water
- Into forest: **Blocked** - tanks cannot enter forest (trees block movement)

### 5. Bullet Testing

Fire bullets:
- Across grass: Bullets pass through
- Across water: Bullets pass over water
- Into forest: Bullets hit trees and despawn (forest blocks bullets)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Map looks different on client vs server
**Solution:** This should not happen! Client receives exact terrain from server. Check:
- Client received `TERRAIN_DATA` message (check logs)
- No errors during `TerrainEncoder.decode()` call
- Network connection is stable

### Problem: No lake or forest visible
**Solution:** Check server logs - flood fill should show regions found. If no regions:
- Verify noise thresholds in `ProceduralTerrainGenerator`
- Check that profile has proper LOW and HIGH types defined
- Seed might produce map with very small regions (try server restart for new seed)

### Problem: Multiple scattered regions instead of single
**Solution:** Flood fill not running! Check logs for errors in `ProceduralTerrainGenerator.keepLargestContiguousOverlayRegion()`.

### Problem: Client shows all grass, no overlays
**Solution:**
- Check that `TerrainEncoder` is encoding overlay data (look for `:` in encoded string)
- Verify `TerrainDecoder` correctly parses overlay types
- Check client terrain textures are registered for overlay types

### Problem: Compile error about FastNoiseLite
**Solution:** Make sure `nettank-common/src/main/java/org/chrisgruber/nettank/common/world/noise/FastNoiseLite.java` exists and has package declaration.
